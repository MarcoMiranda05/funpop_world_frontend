This is the FunPop World! This app gathers together everything that I learnt during 15 weeks at Flatiron School. It was a lot of hard work and I'm very grateful for what I've achieved.

The project has Ruby on Rails as backend and React.js as front-end. Also, many hours in CSS were dedicated to the app. 

FunPop World! allows the user to track his Funko Pop! collection, make a wishlist and provides a trading platform with other collectors.
